# crangraph

## Project Overview

`crangraph` is an application which aims to visualize and make available data related to the interdepdencies between R packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)).

## Background

This project was completed as part of the requirements of a course in UC-Berkeley's MIDS program, "W205: Storing and Retrieving Data".

## Setup

### 1. Create an EC2 instance

a. Create an EC2 instance using the `Amazon Linux AMI` (ami-c58c1dd3)
    - you should use at least a `t2.2xlarge` instance type
b. In the "Add Storage" stage of creating your AMI, add an EBS volume, general purpose SSD, with at least 80GB of storage
c. In the "Configure Security Group" stage, add the following rules:

- (Custom TCP Rule) 4040, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 5000, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 7180, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 7474, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 8080, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 8088, 0.0.0.0/0
- (Custom TCP Rule) 50070, 0.0.0.0/0
- (SSH) 22, 0.0.0.0/0
- (HTTP) 80, 0.0.0.0/0

d. Other than the options above, use default settings given by AWS

### 2. Run Setup script

a. SSH into the EC2 instance you just created. This can be done with a command of the form:

```
ssh -i /path/to/my_keypair.pem ec2-user@<EC_PUBLIC_DNS>.amazonaws.com
```

b. Be sure that you are in home

```
cd $HOME
```

c. Grab the setup script

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jameslamb/crangraph/dev/setup/setup_instance.sh > setup_instance.sh
```

d. Make this script executable:

```
chmod a+rwx setup_instance.sh
```

e. This setup script is going to install all of the needed components for running this application, including Kafka, Postgres, Storm, and many others. Before these applications can be installed, the script needs to mount the EBS volume you created so that it can use that volume for storage. Execute the following:

```
sudo fdisk -l | grep ^Disk
```

f. You will see a few lines of output that show disk size and the name of the volume. Use the disk size to identify the EBS volume you created. Note that this will not be exact...if you asked for 80 GB you may get a number like "85.9 GB". Here is an example output line that might represent a volume called `/dev/xvdb`:

**Disk /dev/xvdb: 85.9 GB, 85899345920 bytes, 167772160 sectors**

g. Now that you've identified the name of your EBS volume (e.g. `/dev/xvdb`), run the setup script:

```
./setup_instance.sh <name_of_your_volume>
```

h. The setup script is as automated as possible, but there are a few items which will need input from you. The prompts and the answers you should provide are given below.

- *WARNING!! This will format the drive at /dev/xvdb. Press any key to continue or control-C to quit...*: **ENTER**
- *In order to continue the installation process, please review the license agreement. Please, press ENTER to continue*: **ENTER**
- *[misc. Anaconda license stuff]*: **'d' until you hit the end**
- *Do you approve the license terms? [yes|no]*: **yes ENTER**
- *Anaconda2 will now be installed into this location...*: **ENTER**
- *Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda2 install location to PATH in your /home/ec2-user/.bashrc ?*: **yes ENTER**
- *Please enter the public DNS name of your EC2 instance:* **your_ec2_public_dns_name**

i. After the setup script completes, either open a new terminal window or run `source ~/.bashrc`. This ensures that anything added to your PATH during the setup script will be available to call from the terminal

## Running the App (Back End)

All instructions below assume that you have ssh'd into an AMI like the one described above. Open 3 terminals to run individual components of the app.

### Terminal1: Kafka

```
source ~/.bashrc
cd /home/ec2-user/crangraph/kafka
./start_kafka.sh
```

### Terminal2: Producer

```
source ~/.bashrc
cd /home/ec2-user/crangraph/kafka
chmod a+rwx producer.py
source activate crangraph
./producer.py
```

### Terminal3: Storm

```
source ~/.bashrc
cd /home/ec2-user/crangraph/storm
source activate crangraph
sparse run
```

## Running the App (Front End)

The front end of `crangraph` is a Flask-power D3 network visualization of the dependency graph for any package requested by a user. To get the UI up and running, simply run the following in a terminal window inside the EC2:

```
cd $HOME/crangraph/ui
source activate crangraph
chmod a+rwx run_app.sh
```

Once you run the commands above, you can access the app's front end simply by navigating to your EC's public DNS name in your browser. You can also get a JSON representation of any state of the graph as follows:

```
curl <EC_PUBLIC_DNS>/data/<package_name>
```
